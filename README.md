# MinivLLM-Fixed

> A fully runnable minimal vLLM inference engine for learning LLM inference internals — self-contained paged & flash attention, tensor-parallel Qwen3/Llama support, KV cache management, and custom CUDA decode kernels.

First, many thanks to the original author for providing a minimal vLLM implementation that makes vLLM much easier to learn. However, the original MiniVLLM project is not yet complete: it contains a number of bugs and cannot reliably run an end-to-end tensor-parallel (TP) inference pipeline with correct scheduling and KV cache management.

This repository provides a fully runnable MiniVLLM inference framework. It fixes the bugs in the original project and adds new features on top of it. Bug fixes and new features are published as releases, each with a corresponding commit ID range, so learners can follow the releases step by step to fix the bugs, understand each new feature, or build their own features.

> **Inference starting point:** Release 8 is the first fully end-to-end runnable release. Start with Release 8 or a newer version when running inference or benchmarks; earlier releases are incremental learning checkpoints and may not run the complete inference pipeline.

A custom implementation of vLLM inference engine with attention mechanism benchmarks, based on Nano-vLLM but with self-contained paged attention and flash attention implementation. 

Benchmarking on flash attention in prefilling time and paged attention in decoding time are provided.

**New to vLLM?** Check out [HowToApproachvLLM.md](HowToApproachvLLM.md) for a step-by-step implementation guide covering layers, models, paged attention, CUDA graphs, and scheduling.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Install uv package manager
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Sync dependencies
uv sync

# Run the main inference engine
uv run python main.py

# Run prefilling benchmark
uv run python tests/benchmarks/benchmark_attention_prefill.py

# Run decoding benchmark
uv run python tests/benchmarks/benchmark_attention_decode.py --mode benchmark
```

To run multi-GPU setting, simply change world_size to n > 1 in config in main.py

## What Each Script Does

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

This is the main inference engine demo

Demonstrates the complete LLM inference pipeline using a custom engine implementation:
- Create a small version of Qwen3 with random initialization
- Creates 60 chat prompts (2 base prompts repeated 30 times each)
- Processes them through the custom LLM engine with batch processing
- Uses paged attention and KV cache management for efficient inference
- Generates up to 256 tokens per prompt with temperature sampling

This showcases how the custom vLLM implementation handles batched text generation with memory-efficient attention.

```bash
uv run python tests/benchmarks/benchmark_attention_prefill.py
```

This is the pefilling phase comparison

Compares three attention implementations during the **prefilling phase** (processing input prompts):

1. **PyTorch Standard (O(N²) memory)**: Traditional attention that materializes full attention matrix
2. **Naive Triton (O(N²) memory)**: GPU kernel that also uses O(N²) memory, limited by shared memory constraints (≤128 tokens)
3. **Flash Attention (O(N) memory)**: Memory-efficient online softmax algorithm that processes attention in blocks

```bash
uv run python tests/benchmarks/benchmark_attention_decode.py --mode benchmark
```

This is the decoding phase comparison

Compares the production implementations during the **decoding phase** (generating output tokens one at a time):

1. **Original Paged Attention Decode**: The original single-stage Triton implementation
2. **Large-scale Split-KV Decode**: The optimized two-stage GQA implementation used by Qwen3-32B

The driver also provides correctness and CUDA profiling modes. See the complete [test and benchmark catalog](tests/README.md).
